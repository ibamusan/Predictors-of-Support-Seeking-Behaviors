Title: Predictors of Support-Seeking Behaviors: A Data-Driven Analysis of Internal and External Support Preferences.
Making decisions about where to turn for support when facing illness is a crucial aspect of our well-being. Do we rely on our loved ones or seek help from service providers? The report aimed to investigate the predictors of internal (Family and friends) and external (service provider) support and develop a prediction model to accurately identify the likelihood of individuals seeking these support sources The report analysed a large dataset containing information from 43,636 observations and 199 variables. After careful selection and transformation, the final dataset included 18 variables and 29,088 observations, focusing on factors relevant to support-seeking behaviors.
The findings of the report highlight significant factors that influence the choice between internal and external support sources. Variables such as household structure, frequency of child contact, community affinity, and long-term care service usage were found to have notable effects on support-seeking behaviors. These insights provide a better understanding of the factors that individuals consider when seeking support.
The prediction model developed in the report demonstrated strong accuracy, correctly predicting support sources with a success rate of 96.48%. This indicates the model's effectiveness in identifying individuals who are more likely to seek internal or external support based on the selected variables. 
The findings and recommendations presented in this report have significant practical implications. By gaining an understanding of the factors that influence support-seeking behaviors, service providers and policymakers can make informed decisions to improve support services and better address the needs of individuals.
